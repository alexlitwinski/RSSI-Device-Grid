### Full Configuration Options

```yaml
type: custom:rssi-device-grid
title: WiFi Devices
service_domain: tplink_omada
service_action: reconnect_client
mac_param: mac
format_mac: true
columns_order:
  - name
  - rssi
  - mac
  - ip
  - actions
show_offline: true
max_devices: 0
sort_by: name
sort_order: asc
state_text: true
alternating_rows: true
show_filter: true
filter_placeholder: Filter devices...
sortable_columns:
  - name

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | string | `RSSI Devices` | Card title |
| `service_domain` | string | `tplink_omada` | Service domain for reconnect |
| `service_action` | string | `reconnect_client` | Service name for reconnect |
| `mac_param` | string | `mac` | Parameter name for MAC address |
| `format_mac` | boolean | `true` | Format MAC address (replace : with - and uppercase) |
| `columns_order` | array | `['name', 'rssi', 'mac', 'ip', 'actions']` | Column order |
| `show_offline` | boolean | `true` | Show offline devices |
| `max_devices` | number | `0` | Maximum devices to show (0 = unlimited) |
| `sort_by` | string | `name` | Default sort column |
| `sort_order` | string | `asc` | Default sort order (asc/desc) |
| `state_text` | boolean | `true` | Show state indicator |
| `alternating_rows` | boolean | `true` | Use alternating row colors |
| `show_filter` | boolean | `true` | Show filter input |
| `filter_placeholder` | string | `Filter devices...` | Placeholder for filter input |
| `sortable_columns` | array | `['name', 'rssi', 'mac', 'ip']` | Columns that can be sorted |
| `enable_sorting` | boolean | `true` | Enable column sorting |

## How It Works

1. The card finds all entities ending with "RSSI" in their name
2. For each entity, it locates the associated device and finds any device_tracker entities for that device
3. If multiple device_tracker entities exist, it prioritizes ones with "home" state
4. MAC address and IP are extracted from the device_tracker attributes
5. When the reconnect button is clicked, it calls the Omada service with the MAC address as a parameter

## Example Use Cases

- Monitor WiFi signal strength for devices on your network
- Easily reconnect devices with poor signal
- Track device IP addresses
- Monitor device connection status
